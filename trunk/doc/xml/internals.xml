<chapter>The CppLua table</chapter>
Lua API does not provide direct means by which a user can obtain a reference to a lua object on the stack. There is a clear reason for this limitation: lua objects can be garbage-collected when there are no more references to them, if popping a value from the stack and storing it in a C variable were possible, one could end up having references to garbarge-collected
